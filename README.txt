These are my solutions to the free online course. I'll update these as I complete the course. Hopefully they can help you!

Git user NatashaTheRobot helped immensely as well. Check out NatashaTheRobot's page for taking CS106A: https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/Stanford-CS-106A/wiki/Stanford-Introduction-To-Computer-Science-Programming-Methodology-CS106A-Class-Guide
